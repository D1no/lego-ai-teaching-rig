# [WIP] Lego AI Teaching Rig

This is a project to illustrate, test and tinker with traditional Kinematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision; showcasing how different types of machine learning and software engineering practices conceptually integrate with another. It leverages Lego Technic and the Mindstorms, Robot Inventor and Spark Prime ecosystem to have a physical robot that can be used to teach AI concepts and challenges.
